## Description  
This is a proof of existence DApp. This DApp provides a UI that allows users to interact with IPFS as well as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This application allows users to register and obtain time stamped picture

All image and video data are stored in **IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)** in order to become decentralized. 

***

## User Stories  
<!-- A user logs into the web app by **uPort**. The user can upload some data (pictures/video) to the app, as well as add a list of tags indicating the contents of the data.

In connection with Ropsten testnetwork by **MetaMask**, the smart contract reads the userâ€™s address and shows the data that they have previously uploaded. -->

Users can retrieve necessary reference data about their uploaded items to allow other people to verify the data authenticity.
