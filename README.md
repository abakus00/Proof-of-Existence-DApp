# "Proof of Existence dApp" 

## Description  
This application allows users to register and obtain time stamped picture

All image and video data are stored in **IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)** in order to become decentralized. 

***

## User Stories  
<!-- A user logs into the web app by **uPort**. The user can upload some data (pictures/video) to the app, as well as add a list of tags indicating the contents of the data.

In connection with Ropsten testnetwork by **MetaMask**, the smart contract reads the userâ€™s address and shows the data that they have previously uploaded. -->

Users can retrieve necessary reference data about their uploaded items to allow other people to verify the data authenticity.
